# 120 Days Purple Teaming & Cloud Incident Response – Days 14–16

## Overview
These notes cover Day 14 to Day 16 of my hands-on cloud security journey. The focus was on exploring CloudTrail logs, building Kibana searches, and practicing AWS CLI to trigger events. Documentation is key — I’ve logged each step, issues faced, and lessons learned.

## Day 14 – Explore CloudTrail Fields and Structure
**Objective:** Understand CloudTrail logs for key security insights.

**Steps:**
1. Open AWS Management Console → CloudTrail → Event history.
2. Focus on key fields:  
   - `eventName` – action performed  
   - `userIdentity` – who performed it  
   - `sourceIP` – originating IP  
3. Analyze how different actions are recorded and how logs can be used for auditing and threat detection.

**Lessons Learned:**
- CloudTrail logs are rich with actionable security information.
- Understanding structure is essential for proactive incident response.

## Day 15 – Build Kibana Saved Searches
**Objective:** Visualize and search important security events in Kibana.

**Steps:**
1. Open Kibana → Discover → select index pattern for CloudTrail logs.
2. Create saved searches for critical events:  
   - `ConsoleLogin` failures  
   - S3 `GetObject` events  
3. Save searches for repeated monitoring and alerting.

**Lessons Learned:**
- Kibana helps quickly identify anomalies.
- Saved searches streamline recurring analysis tasks.

## Day 16 – Practice AWS CLI to Trigger CloudTrail Events
**Objective:** Correlate CLI activity with CloudTrail logs.

**Steps:**
1. Use AWS CLI to perform S3 operations:  
   - `aws s3 mb s3://<bucket-name>` – create bucket  
   - `aws s3 ls` – list buckets  
   - `aws s3 rb s3://<bucket-name>` – delete bucket  
2. Verify the corresponding events in CloudTrail.
3. Compare GUI vs CLI workflows for auditing and response.

**Lessons Learned:**
- Real-time correlation between CLI actions and CloudTrail is crucial.
- Practicing CLI commands improves incident response readiness.
- GUI and CLI complement each other for thorough monitoring.

## Key Takeaways (Days 14–16)
- Understanding CloudTrail fields is fundamental for security monitoring.
- Kibana saved searches allow efficient visualization and anomaly detection.
- Hands-on CLI practice reinforces knowledge and helps anticipate real-world incidents.
- Documentation ensures lessons are retained and can be shared for future reference.

**Next Steps:**  
- Continue with Day 17 to explore dashboards and log visualizations.  
- Keep documenting all steps, challenges, and solutions to build a complete reference repository.
