# Day 1 – Building the Foundation

## Objective
Today I started my 120-Day Challenge focused on Purple Teaming and Cloud Incident Response. The main goal was to set up a **secure AWS environment** for hands-on labs.

## Tasks Completed
- Created AWS account (Free Tier)
- Enabled billing alerts to monitor costs
- Configured Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for added security

## Lessons Learned
- Security starts at the foundation — even simple steps like enabling MFA prevent major issues later.
- Monitoring costs early avoids surprises when building labs.
- Documenting every step ensures reproducibility for future labs.

## Next Steps
Tomorrow (Day 2), I will start building **attacker and victim machines** to explore Red/Blue/Purple team interactions in the cloud.
