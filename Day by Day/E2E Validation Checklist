Run this checklist to validate your lab: (some important steps to look on)

[ ] Describe instances and verify public/private IPs
[ ] Confirm subnet route table has 0.0.0.0/0 -> IGW (for public)
[ ] Ensure target SG allows necessary ports from attacker (22, 5985, 5986, 5601 as needed)
[ ] Ensure Windows has WinRM listener and firewall rule
[ ] From attacker: nc -vz <IP> <port> returns Connected
[ ] From attacker: curl http(s) to /wsman returns 401 or XML (WinRM)
[ ] pywinrm whoami returns user (test)
[ ] evil-winrm interactive shell (optional)
[ ] Kibana reachable at :5601 and index pattern created
[ ] Terraform init works and state consistent (if using Terraform)
